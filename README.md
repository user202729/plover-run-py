# plover-run-py
Command plugin for Plover to run an arbitrary Python command.

See also:

* [`plover-run-shell` plugin](https://github.com/user202729/plover_run_shell) for running a shell command.
* [`plover-debugging-console` plugin](https://github.com/user202729/plover-debugging-console) for
running Python commands in Plover in a shell (more convenient for debugging and showing results).
* [`plover-retro-stringop` plugin](https://github.com/buffet/plover_retro_stringop) for
running Python commands to transform/modify the previous text using arbitrary Python expression.

## Usage

In order to use this plugin in [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) you need to
create a dictionary entry of the form:

``` json
{
    "example_stroke": "{PLOVER:PY:command}"
}
```

Variables `engine` and `plover` are provided.

Remember to escape the characters in `\{}` according to Plover's dictionary format.

Alternatively, if the definition has the form `"{PLOVER:PY_F:path}"`, the content of the file
at the given path will be run as Python code.

**Note**: If the command takes a long time to finish, Plover might freeze.
